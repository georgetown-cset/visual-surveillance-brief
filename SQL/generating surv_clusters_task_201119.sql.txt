--from our list of 1769 clusters, filter to those with a significant number of CV pipeline papers (>30) and with a >50% rate of those papers being tagged as surveillance
--empirically, we think this does a fairly good job of capturing surveillance-focused clusters (high precision), although it likely misses a decent number as well (uncertain recall).
